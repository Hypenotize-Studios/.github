# Hypenotize Studios

This is the organization-wide README.

Currently, I am the **only member**, but everything here is structured so that **anyone joining in the future can quickly find their way around**.

---

## Goal

- Keep all projects organized  
- Standardize processes and decisions  
- Make maintenance and organizational growth easier  

---

## Repository Types

- **Game projects**: complete games or prototypes  
- **Systems / libraries**: reusable code shared across projects  
- **Tools**: internal scripts, automation, and utilities  
- **Documentation**: studio guides and standards  

Each repository must have its own README.

---

## General Standards

- Commits follow **Conventional Commits** (`feat(scope): description`)  
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer) when applicable  
- Automation (CI/CD) whenever possible  

---

## Simple Rule

If something causes confusion more than once, **it must be documented**.
